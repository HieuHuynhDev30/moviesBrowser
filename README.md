# moviesbrowser
This is a simple movies browsing site created for the purpose of React study. 
The site is composed of three main functions which are movies showcase, movies searching and movies recommendation.
The site uses data fetched from TMDB, a movie browsing site with free API.
During the making, plenty of features were applied to the design, which makes this project outstanding. I spent nearly 2 weeks completing this project.
The site is one of many projects I made while I was learning web development in Udemy.
